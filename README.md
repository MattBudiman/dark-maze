# dark-maze
Dark Maze is an original maze game. The driver class is located in `DarkMaze.java`.

The maze is intially pitch black, and its contents are only visible when the light is turned on using the light toggle button on the lower left-hand corner, hence the name "Dark Maze." The player, designated with a white dot, navigates the maze using the buttons using the buttons located on the right-hand corner of the screen. The objective of the game is to reach the goal, which is desiginated with a green circle when the light is on, while avoiding hazards, which are designated with a red cirle when the light is on. Landing on a square with a hazard results in losing a life and starting back from the original starting position. Additionally, the light, though able to be toggled on and off, only has a limited amount of energy before it dies completely and the maze goes pitch black again. In order to combat these difficulties, the player may collect lives, which are desiginated by the blue plus sign, and energy boosts, which are desiginated by the orange plus sign. When the player reaches the goal, a "YOU WIN" message appears.
